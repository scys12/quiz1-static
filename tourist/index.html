                                        Base-G, which is one of Jayapura's city icons, is full of historical value.
                                        The name Base-G comes from the beach's initial function as a "homebase" for Allied troops in World War 2.
                                        The letter "G" (alphabetical order 7) indicates that this place is the 7th "homebase".
                                        It is said that at that time , Base-G Beach became the point of gathering strength for the Allied forces led
                                        by General McArthur before attacking Japanese troops in the Philippines.
                                        Compared to other beaches in Jayapura City, Base G Beach has bigger waves because of its geographic location which
                                        is directly opposite the Pacific Ocean. But there is no need to worry
                                        because the manager has installed a coral breaker about one kilometer from the beach to reduce the size of the waves.
                                        From a distance, you can see a long, sloping coastline with blue water. Base G beach looks very pretty and beautiful.
                                        Plus the green trees that grow around the beach, really are a blend of extraordinary natural beauty.

                                        Usually people come to the transmitter hill in the morning,because indeed from the top of the hill
                                        the sunrise will be seen above the sea. Meanwhile, in the afternoon at the transmitter hill,
                                        the sunset will be covered by the Cyclop ridge. But due to the consideration of the location of the basecamp in Abepura,
                                        it is rather difficult to enjoy the sunrise on this transmitter hill. The journey from Abepura to the top of the transmitter hill 
                                        in Jayapura is about thirty minutes by car. It is called the transmitter hill because the transmitter for several television stations
                                        is installed on this hill. The transmitter hill is also one of the highest points in the city of Jayapura.
                                        When viewed from a distance there is a large inscription that says JAYAPURA CITY which will glow at night,
                                        next to it is a large cross marking Jayapura city.
