                                        Abon Gulung is a typical Manokwari snack that is often found at every airport in Papua and West Papua. Rolled shredded is actually a roll that contains shredded in the middle. 
                                        But somehow the softness of this bread which usually tastes sweet has changed to a savory taste. So it is very suitable to be used as a main course not an appetizer.
                                        This bread is only produced by one bakery named Hawai Bakery which is located in Manokwari. However, these Hawai Bakery outlets, which are quite widely scattered in several cities in Papua airports
                                        , such as Sorong, Jayapura, Biak, Nabire to Merauke airports, certainly have shredded rolled outlets. The slogan of Abon Roll Hawaiian which reads "oleh-oleh khas Manokwari".
