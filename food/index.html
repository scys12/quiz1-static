                                        Papeda, or bubur sagu, is sago congee, a staple food of native people in Maluku Islands and Papua Islands. 
                                        It is commonly found in eastern Indonesia, as the counterpart of central and western Indonesian cuisines that favour rice as their staple food.
                                        Papeda is made from sago starch. The Moluccans and Papuans acquire the starch by felling the trunk of a sago palm tree, cutting it in half, 
                                        and scraping the soft inner parts of the trunk, the pith, producing a crude sago pith flour. This flour is then mixed with water and squeezed to leach the starch from the flour. 
                                        The still-moist sago starch is usually stored in a container made of sago palm leaflets, called tumang, in which it will keep for several months before spontaneous fermentation will turn it too acidic and unsuitable for making papeda.

                                        Abon Gulung is a typical Manokwari snack that is often found at every airport in Papua and West Papua. Rolled shredded is actually a roll that contains shredded in the middle. 
                                        But somehow the softness of this bread which usually tastes sweet has changed to a savory taste. So it is very suitable to be used as a main course not an appetizer.
                                        This bread is only produced by one bakery named Hawai Bakery which is located in Manokwari. However, these Hawai Bakery outlets, which are quite widely scattered in several cities in Papua airports
                                        , such as Sorong, Jayapura, Biak, Nabire to Merauke airports, certainly have shredded rolled outlets. The slogan of Abon Roll Hawaiian which reads "oleh-oleh khas Manokwari".
