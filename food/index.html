                                        Papeda, or bubur sagu, is sago congee, a staple food of native people in Maluku Islands and Papua Islands. 
                                        It is commonly found in eastern Indonesia, as the counterpart of central and western Indonesian cuisines that favour rice as their staple food.
                                        Papeda is made from sago starch. The Moluccans and Papuans acquire the starch by felling the trunk of a sago palm tree, cutting it in half, 
                                        and scraping the soft inner parts of the trunk, the pith, producing a crude sago pith flour. This flour is then mixed with water and squeezed to leach the starch from the flour. 
                                        The still-moist sago starch is usually stored in a container made of sago palm leaflets, called tumang, in which it will keep for several months before spontaneous fermentation will turn it too acidic and unsuitable for making papeda.

                                        Abon Gulung is a typical Manokwari snack that is often found at every airport in Papua and West Papua. Rolled shredded is actually a roll that contains shredded in the middle. 
                                        But somehow the softness of this bread which usually tastes sweet has changed to a savory taste. So it is very suitable to be used as a main course not an appetizer.
                                        This bread is only produced by one bakery named Hawai Bakery which is located in Manokwari. However, these Hawai Bakery outlets, which are quite widely scattered in several cities in Papua airports
                                        , such as Sorong, Jayapura, Biak, Nabire to Merauke airports, certainly have shredded rolled outlets. The slogan of Abon Roll Hawaiian which reads "oleh-oleh khas Manokwari".

                                        Sago is processed into several foods, one of the most famous and iconic ones is papeda with a pair of yellow sauce.
                                        Apart from papeda, other processed sago foods are plate sago. This plate of sago is food in Papua and West Papua.
                                        Usually, people enjoy sago plates with tea or coffee. Sago plates mean processed sago in the form of plates.
                                        Apart from Papua and West Papua, plate sago can also be found in other provinces, namely Maluku, Riau and Kalimantan.
                                        Sago plates are also a mandatory game for travelers. But it is very difficult to find in places to eat 
                                        because this bread is a family consumption and is usually eaten immediately after cooking.
                                        Making sago plates is as easy as making other bread. Sago is processed by burning it by printing rectangles or squares with iron.
                                        Initial taste, tasteless. But lately it has started to vary with sugar to get a sweet taste.
                                        The texture is hard and can be enjoyed by mixing it or dipping it in water to make it softer.

                                        Selingkuh Shrimp is the name for freshwater shrimp that you can find in the Baliem River, Papua.
                                        Called cheating shrimp because the result of the shrimp broodstock "having an affair" with the crab
                                        because it looks like shrimp but has crab claws. Cheating shrimp is a crayfish type crayfish or crayfish that 
                                        has crab claws with a slightly bluish color. Cheating shrimp is usually served grilled with minimal seasoning, 
                                        which is only salt. That is, if really needed. The reason is, the slightly sweet natural taste of this animal makes it delicious to eat.
                                        The serving of cheating shrimp is usually accompanied by warm rice and papaya or kale.
                                        It's even more delicious with the colo-colo sambal combination which has a spicy-sweet taste
