                                Jayapura is the capital and largest city of the Indonesian province of Papua.
                                It is situated on the northern coast of New Guinea island and covers an area of 935.92 km2 (361.36 sq mi).
                                The city borders the Pacific Ocean and Yos Sudarso Bay to the north, Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea to the east,
                                Keerom Regency to the south, and Jayapura Regency to the west. It is the most populous city in the Indonesian part of New
                                Guinea with a population of 256,705 at the 2010 census. The latest official estimate (as of January 2014) is 315,872.

                                Jayapura is Sanskrit for "city of victory" (जय jaya: "victory"; पुर pura: "city") and was named by Suharto as part of the de-Sukarnoization.
                                The last battle against the Dutch was fought in the city in August 1962. Nowadays there are calls from some citizens to rename the city as Port Numbay, 
                                although the "Port" name itself is English-sounding and not a local-based word.
                                During the Dutch colonial era the city was called Hollandia, based on the Holland region. 
                                In 1945, the Dutch made Hollandia the capital of then Netherlands New Guinea. After the territory was handed over to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, 
                                on 1 October 1962, the city went by a dual Dutch/Indonesian name: Hollandia/Kota Baru (New Town). 
                                When Indonesia took control over the city on 1 May 1963, it became solely Kota Baru. In 1964, the city was briefly renamed Sukarnopura, 
                                after then-President Sukarno, until the end of 1968, when it acquired its present name.

                                Jayapura is the home of the Persipura, a professional football club that has produced many famous Papuan-Indonesian footballers and have won the Indonesia
                                Super League three times in the 2008–09, 2010–11 and the 2012–13 seasons.
                                Persipura plays its home matches in the Mandala Stadium.
                                As the 2020 edition edition of National Sports Week (PON) is hosted by Papua province, 
                                Jayapura is selected as one of the games venues. Papua Bangkit Main Stadium is currently being built as the 2020 PON main venue.
